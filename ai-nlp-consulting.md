# AI NLP Consulting

# Background

## Amounts of Textual Data
* Most of people's communications are text
* Humanity has accumulated enormous amounts of text information
* Books exist for thousands of years
* Most of this is now digitized
* Internet has multiplied the amount of text information
* Oral communications can be transcribed to text

## Early Processing of Textual Data
* With the above mentioned amounts of textual data,
there has been a long-standing interest in automation of text processing
* First practical NLP started with the invention of Internet
and prolifiration of search
* Most of these early attemps were useful but amounted to statistical calculations
* The statistical methods are limited in their precision because
they ignore the word order and loose the meaning
* These methods are called bag-of-words 
* An example is TF-IDF (term frequency/inverse document frequency)
* It is a 20-year old technology popularized by search engines

## NLP Revolution of 2013-2019
* The first approach that tries to preserve word order and calculate the meaning was
word2vec (Tomas Mikolov, 2013)
* word2vec is based on neural networks
* After a number iterations, the next very significan step was BERT
(Google, 2018)
* BERT is based on a new type of neural network called Transformer
* BERT started a slew of breakthrough technologies
* All BERT approaches allow to deal with meaning and not just keywords
* Google, Bing, Baidu all use BERT in their searches

## BERT Significance and Applications
* BERT opened a way to revolutionize
    - Customer service
    - Computer-human interaction
    - Document understanding
    - Genome analysis
    - Financial document understanding
    - And many more
    
# The Need for Consulting

## Market Opportunity
* The above technologies are revolutionary
* They are also open sourced
* The models are pretrained
    - You can re-use generic text understanding training done by others
    
## Skills Gap
* But the technology requires understanding
* Since the technology breakthroughs are based on years of research and improvements
    - They presents challenges in understanding and correct implementations
* Training helps but still leaves a big need for hand-holding
* Compare this to watching figure skating
    * You will be able to appreciate
    * But not be able to skate yourself
* Luckily, it is not as hard
